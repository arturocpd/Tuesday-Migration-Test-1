                    Dear {{{Recipient.Name}}},<br />
                    <br />
                    Hope you're doing well! <br />
                    <br />
                    I noticed that you'd previously applied for a {{{RecruitmentPosting.PostingTitle}}} role at {{{Organization.Name}}}, and I wanted to reach out about a new opening that might be a great fit for you.<br />
                    <br />
                    Based on your background and what I saw in your application, I think you could be a strong candidate.<br />
                    <br />
                    If you're interested in learning more and applying, you can find the job posting <a href="&lt;site-url>/s/recruitmentposting/{{{RecruitmentPosting.Id}}}">here</a>.<br />
                    <br />
                    Sincerely,<br />
                    {{{Sender.Name}}}<br />
                    {{{Organization.Name}}}, {{{Sender.Department}}}
